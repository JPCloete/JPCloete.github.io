Graph-Calculator is a javascript program for graphing mathematical functions, differential equations (and vector fields?). 
At the moment the grid -and movement functionality is finished and I'm satisfied with the performance and "feel" of it. 
I still need to add the functionality do draw functions and that will require a tokenized parser and the use of bezier curves to draw the functions.
